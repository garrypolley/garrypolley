On this day in 2021 I was working on my weekend ritual of solving the Suko and Cell Blocks puzzles.
I've wondered each weekend if there is a Suko puzzle. I finally wanted to check _after_ solving the puzzle
to see if there was a solver. I grabbed my phone and searched the web. The internet seems to yield no
obvious results. So here we are - I want to create a Suko solver. I'm working on this now. 

We shall see if this post updates in the next few hours with a solver on screen ðŸ¤ž...
