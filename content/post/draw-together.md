# Draw Together

This is a new project I'm working on. It's a fun game to help people draw together.

The inspiration came from watching my oldest kiddo play a game on the iPad. She was drawing and making up a story, and I thought: "That'd be way more fun if we could do that together.".

So over the course of the last month I've been working on and off creating this site:

https://d.drawtogether.fun

The site may change overtime, or not.  Right now you can go there and draw what you want. There's an AppleTV viewer app that will come out soon, working out some kinks still.

Let me know what you think! garrympolley+drawtogether@gmail.com
