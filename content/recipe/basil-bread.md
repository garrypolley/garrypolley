ingredients: [
    {
    name: "Basil",
    amount: "2.00 (g)"
    },
    {
    name: "Bread Flour",
    amount: "500.00 (g)"
    },
    {
    name: "Olive Oil",
    amount: "45.00 (g)"
    },
    {
    name: "Salt",
    amount: "10.00 (g)"
    },
    {
    name: "Water",
    amount: "320.00 (ml)"
    },
    {
    name: "Yeast",
    amount: "7.00 (g)"
    }
]
steps: [
    "Put Flour, salt, and yeast in bowl (yeast to one side)",
    "Put in olive oil and basil.",
    "Put in about 3/4 of the water and begin stirring with your hand",
    "Continue adding remaining water and hand mixing until it feels a little sticky",
    "Turn out of bowl and begin kneading on a very lightly floured surface (adding oil as needed to keep from sticking to your hands). Do this for about 10 - 15 minutes, or until it feels right.",
    "Let rise in an oiled bowl until it doubles (about 2 hours), cover the bowl.",
    "Tilted out of bowl onto a floured surface. Fatten the air out, and put into a \"loaf\" form folding the sides underneath. Placing into an oiled bread tin, cover and let rise until doubled (it is just over the top of the loaf tin), about 1-2 hours.",
    "Heat oven to 205 C with fan. Cook for 35 minutes, look and make sure bread is good. Take out and if tapping the bottom sounds hollow, then place on a wire cooling rack until cool. Then store how you want."
