    "Gently pour in 3/4 of the water and begin \"churning\" together with your hand like a claw",
    "Pour in the remainder of the water and finishing mixing, if it seems too dry add about 5Ml of water at a time and keep mixing",
    "Knead the bread with a dusting of flour on your work surface",
    "Put bread in a lightly oiled bowl sealed with cling wrap, let rise for about 2 hours (until doubled)",
    "Dust work surface with flour, gently pour out dough and spread into a rough rectangle (pushing out air) on the surface",
    "Sprinkle the oregano and basil over the surface of the dough, covering the entire surface",
    "Fold the dough from side to middle from both ends, then from top to bottom, roll out on flour, and then cut into 4 pieces",
    "Place the 4 pieces on a baking sheet and cover to rise until doubled again (roughly 2 hours)",
    "Place a dish with water in the bottom of the oven, then heat the oven to 205 C with fan",
    "Cut 3 diagonal slices in each slice then place bread in oven for 15 minutes, then lower the oven to 180 C for 20-25 minutes",
    "Take the bread out and let it cool for about 15 minutes (the bread continues to cook while out of the oven)"
